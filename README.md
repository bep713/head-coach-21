## Installation Guide

- [<img width="20" src="https://logo-logos.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PlayStation_logo.png"> PS3 click here](#ps3-steps)

After installing, make sure to use the HC09 Editor (included in the downloaded  files below) to change your user controlled team. The career file will start with the Chiefs as the default team if you do not change anything. You will need to bruteforce your files if you are on PS3 before you can change your team in the editor.

### PC Steps

1. Before using the mod, you must install RPCS3. You can find the [quickstart guide to set up the emulator here](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart). If you have any questions about RPCS3 in general such as good settings to use, feel free to ask in the [official RPCS3 Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Af7H9yp).

1. If you have set up RPCS3 before, delete your games.yml file in your RPCS3 folder. If you are setting up RPCS3 for the first time, you can skip this step.

1. Make sure your game folder is named EXACTLY BLUS30128-[NFL Head Coach 09] or else the Easy Installer will not work. Then, open up your RPCS3 folder and place your game folder in dev_hdd0/disc/. 

1. Next, download the [Easy Installer PKG That comes in this rar file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/75v5382gjsu70pu/HC21_PC_V3.rar/file)

1. Extract all contents to a new folder.

1. To put the roster save into your emulator, just copy the Career folder into dev_hdd0\home\00000001\savedata inside your RPCS3 folder. 

1. Finally, simply launch RPCS3 and drag the PKG file you just downloaded into the main RPCS3 window. It will take a few minutes to install. You will know it worked if the game icon changes to a HC21 logo. After that, launch the game and enjoy the mods!

### PS3 Steps
#### Prereqs
- PS3 console
- USB drive (8GB or larger)
- Some kind of computer (any Windows PC, Mac, or even Chromebook will work)
- Either a physical game disc or a copy of the game files

---
- If you already have HEN and multiMAN installed on your PS3, you can skip to step 2.
- If you have also copied your disc to your PS3's hard drive already while installing prior mods, you can skip all the way ahead to step 5.

#### PS3 (Disc Copy) Download Instructions

1.	Follow [this great YouTube guide to install HEN and multiMAN on your PS3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOKemRHAZ3c). It should only take 30 minutes to an hour. YOU CAN SKIP THE OPTIONAL STEP from 13:17-14:29.

1.	Start up your PS3 console and click the `Enable HEN` button (if it fails try again until it works). Then place your game disc in your console and launch the multiMAN application you installed earlier.

1.	Now, hover over the HC09 icon and hit Triangle. A menu will pop up. Click copy, then click PS3 HDD (/dev_hdd0). It will probably ask you `Do you want to copy the game from BD-ROM to internall HDD?`. Select `yes`.

1.	This should take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to copy all the files over. Once it is done, you can click Square to continue. Then eject your disc (you will never need your disc again, you can keep it in the case forever) and quit out of multiMAN. If you got an error saying the process was aborted, please clean your disc and try again.

1.	Move over to your computer and download the following file: https://www.mediafire.com/file/80f93xiprs3oit1/HC21_PS3_V3.rar/file

1.	Extract all contents to a new folder. 

1.	Drag and drop the pkg file onto the root of your USB drive (this means they should not be inside any folder). 

1.	To add the roster file, create a new folder on your USB called PS3. Then inside that folder make one called SAVEDATA. Paste the Career file folder from the rar in there.

1.	Plug your USB drive into your PS3, navigate to the game tab on the main menu, scroll down to the bottom, and open the `Package Manager`. Then click `Install Package Files`. Then click `Standard`. You should now see a file called `CUSTOM-INSTALLER_HC21_PS3_V3_A.pkg`. Select it and wait for it to finish installing. Then install the one called `CUSTOM-INSTALLER_HC21_PS3_V3_B.pkg`. If you get an error while installing, go back to the main menu and click on the `enable HEN` button and try again.

1.	Once all parts are finished installing, you can remove the USB drive. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALREADY EJECTED YOUR GAME DISC.

1.	Now, launch multiMAN. Start HC09 by pressing X. It will kick you back out to the main PS3 menu, but you will see a disc icon even though there is no disc inserted. Simply click on that disc icon and it will launch HC09 with our mods installed!
